  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This classic Greek Salad is a vibrant mix of fresh vegetables, tangy feta cheese, and briny Kalamata olives, all drizzled with a zesty olive oil and lemon dressing. It's the perfect balance of crunchy, creamy, and savory flavors, with a touch of Mediterranean flair. Whether you're serving it as a side dish, a light lunch, or alongside grilled meats, this salad is always a crowd-pleaser.</p>
  <p>Full of healthy, colorful ingredients, the Greek Salad is naturally gluten-free and can be made vegan by omitting the feta cheese. With its simple ingredients and refreshing taste, it captures the essence of Greek cuisine and is a great way to add a burst of freshness to any meal.</p>

  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced into thick rounds</li>
      <li>2 large tomatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>1 bell pepper (preferably green), sliced into thin strips</li>
      <li>1/2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted</li>
      <li>200g (7oz) block of feta cheese, cut into thick slices or crumbled</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Prepare the vegetables: Wash and dry the cucumber, tomatoes, and bell pepper. Cut the cucumber into thick slices, halve the tomatoes, and slice the bell pepper into thin rings or strips.</li>
      <li>Prepare the red onion: Peel the red onion and slice it thinly. If you prefer a milder onion flavor, you can soak the onion slices in cold water for 10-15 minutes to reduce the sharpness.</li>
      <li>Prepare the olives and cheese: Drain the Kalamata olives and set aside. Cut the block of feta cheese into thick slices or crumble it lightly into large chunks, depending on your preference.</li>
      <li>Assemble the salad: In a large bowl, combine the cucumber, tomatoes, bell pepper, and red onion. Add the Kalamata olives and top with the feta cheese.</li>
      <li>Prepare the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Taste the dressing and adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
      <li>Toss the salad: Drizzle the dressing evenly over the salad and gently toss the ingredients together. Be careful not to break the feta too much.</li>
      <li>Serve: Garnish with a few extra olives, a sprinkle of dried oregano, and a drizzle of extra olive oil. Serve the salad chilled, alongside pita bread or as a side to grilled meats or seafood.</li>
  </ol>
