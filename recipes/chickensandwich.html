  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 sandwich buns</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tbsp mustard (optional)</li>
      <li>2 leaves romaine lettuce</li>
      <li>2 slices tomato</li>
      <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
      <li>1 slice cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika on both sides.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is fully cooked and golden brown on the outside. If you’re using a thermometer, the internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).</li>
      <li>If you’re adding cheese, place the slice of cheddar cheese on top of the chicken breasts in the last minute of cooking and cover the skillet to melt the cheese.</li>
      <li>While the chicken cooks, toast the sandwich buns in a separate pan or in a toaster until golden and crisp.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and mustard together. Spread the mayo-mustard mixture on the inside of the toasted buns.</li>
      <li>Once the chicken is cooked, assemble the sandwich: Place a piece of chicken on the bottom bun, then layer with a slice of tomato, lettuce, and pickles (if using). Top with the other bun.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately with a side of fries or chips, and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
