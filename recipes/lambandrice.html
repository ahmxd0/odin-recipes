    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500g lamb shoulder, cubed</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
    <li>4 cups water or broth (chicken or vegetable)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp butter (optional, for the rice)</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    <li>Yogurt sauce (optional, for serving)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season the lamb: In a bowl, season the lamb cubes with salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, and paprika. Toss to coat evenly.</li>
    <li>Brown the lamb: Heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned lamb cubes in batches and sear them until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes per batch. Remove the lamb and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Cook the onions and garlic: In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook over medium heat until softened and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Simmer the lamb: Return the lamb to the skillet with the onions and garlic. Add 1 cup of water or broth, and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the lamb is tender. Add more water or broth if needed to keep the lamb from drying out.</li>
    <li>Prepare the rice: While the lamb is cooking, rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water or broth to a boil. Add the rice and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and all the liquid is absorbed. If you’re using butter, stir it into the rice after it’s cooked.</li>
    <li>Assemble the dish: Once the lamb is tender, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Fluff the rice with a fork, then serve a portion of rice on each plate. Top with the lamb and its cooking juices.</li>
    <li>Garnish and serve: Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, and serve with optional yogurt sauce on the side for added flavor.</li>
</ol>
